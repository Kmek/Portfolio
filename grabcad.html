			<h2>GrabCAD</h2>
			<p>GrabCAD is a website where people can upload 3D models for others to download freely. I like using <mark>Autodesk Inventor Pro</mark> to design 3D models, most of which are for 3D printing. The models on this page are displayed using <a href="https://www.vectary.com/" target="_blank"><mark>Vectary</mark></a>.</p>

			<h3>Portal Turret:</h3>
			<p>This is a turret from the game Portal. It is made up of several different parts that could be assembled after printing. This was designed this way so it could be printed using several different filament colors on a single-color 3D printer.</p>

			<h3>Gear Sphere:</h3>
			<p>This is a ball with a layer of movable gears. Only the black pins are glued into the center ball, so the gears can move freely. The teeth fo the gears fit together because they have enough tolerance and extra space. It even makes a nice clicking sound like any other fidget toy.</p>

			<h3>Skeleton Hand:</h3>
			<p>This model was printed as an assembly, so all the individual parts did not need to be attached after 3D printing. The hand moves using many ball and socket joints, which were printed using soluble support material. This means that, rather than picking it out by hand, the support material could be dissolved off the print using an acid bath.</p>

			<h3>Snowflake Ornament:</h3>
			<p>This is a Christmas ornament. It is made of a pattern of snowflakes that create a sphere. Because of this, the print is very delicate. It needed to use soluble support material because it would be tricky to try and pull out supporting plastic from the inside of the sphere.</p>

			<h3>Jack O Lantern:</h3>
			<p>Much like an organic pumpkin, this model was carved. A sketch of the jack o' lantern's face was wrapped around a cylinder and cut out. After that, the shape of the pumpkin was carved from that cylinder. This print is large enough so that the jack o' lantern could hold a battery powered tea candle.</p>
