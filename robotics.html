			<h2>5106C Robotics</h2>
			<p>Ever since freshman year, my friend and I have been on the Kennett Coders robotics team 5106C. Because we're a team of two, we have a lot of work split up. My friend specializes in programming the robot while I mainly work on building the robot. </p>

			<h3>The Starstruck Game</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game was to have the least amount of game elements on your alliance's side of the fence. Robots were allowed to throw and shove stars and cubes through and over the fence, but they weren't allowed to cross the fence themselves. Because they were bigger and fewer in number, cubes were worth more points than stars. There was also an option of hanging a robot on your alliance's pole in the corner of the field. The trick with this was that the robot had to stay hanging in the air after the robot's motors turned off at the end of the match.</p>

			<h3>Checkmate V1</h3>
			<p>My team's first robot was named Checkmate in freshman year, following the pattern of naming the team robot after their chosen letter. We ended up liking the name so much that we kept it every year since. This game's robot was very similar to a rubber band catapult on wheels. This design had an independently moving arm and claw to lift and throw cubes & stars over the fence facing either backwards or forwards. To put less strain on the motors, rubber bands were used to help lift the arm, because these motors were at risk of burning out. A burnt out motor doesn't move, and to fix this it must not be moved for a few valuable seconds. In a match of only two minutes, teams don't want to waste precious seconds doing nothing. For more safety precautions, this robot also had "flipstands", little kickstands that flipped into position, on its backside to prevent the robot from flipping over. Sometimes the robot threw its arm upwards with such a force that the robot would tip over, and when a robot falls it might not get up. This makes the match unfairly into 2 robots vs 1, which the downed alliance usually loses. </p>
			<p>Overall, Checkmate V1 worked very well. As a first year team, 5106C's team qualified for the NH/VT State Championships. We found our own place as a Girl Powered team, and we were a well known and well respected team in our region despite being freshman, as shown by the inspire award (voted for by other teams for a team that is most inspiring). Since this was my first year in robotics, I still had things to learn.</p>

			<p>5106C qualified and competed at the World Championships again in 2019. That year, 5106C ranked 6th in the qualifiers. Because of this, we were picked by 8223B to compete in the elimination rounds.</p>
