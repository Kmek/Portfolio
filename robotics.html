			<h2>5106C Robotics</h2>
			<p>Ever since freshman year, my friend and I have been on the Kennett Coders robotics team 5106C. Because we're a team of two, we have a lot of work split up. My friend specializes in programming the robot while I mainly work on building the robot. </p>

			<h3>The Starstruck Game</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game was to have the least amount of game elements on your alliance's side of the fence. Robots were allowed to throw and shove stars and cubes through and over the fence, but they weren't allowed to cross the fence themselves. Because they were bigger and fewer in number, cubes were worth more points than stars. There was also an option of hanging a robot on your alliance's pole in the corner of the field. The trick with this was that the robot had to stay hanging in the air after the robot's motors turned off at the end of the match.</p>

			<h3>Checkmate V1</h3>
			<p>My team's first robot was named Checkmate in freshman year, following the pattern of naming the team robot after their chosen letter. We ended up liking the name so much that we kept it every year since. This game's robot was very similar to a rubber band catapult on wheels. This design had an independently moving arm and claw to lift and throw cubes & stars over the fence facing either backwards or forwards. To put less strain on the motors, rubber bands were used to help lift the arm, because these motors were at risk of burning out. A burnt out motor doesn't move, and to fix this it must not be moved for a few valuable seconds. In a match of only two minutes, teams don't want to waste precious seconds doing nothing. For more safety precautions, this robot also had "flipstands", little kickstands that flipped into position, on its backside to prevent the robot from flipping over. Sometimes the robot threw its arm upwards with such a force that the robot would tip over, and when a robot falls it might not get up. This makes the match unfairly into 2 robots vs 1, which the downed alliance usually loses. </p>
			<p>Overall, Checkmate V1 worked very well. As a first year team, 5106C's team qualified for the NH/VT State Championships. We found our own place as a Girl Powered team, and we were a well known and well respected team in our region despite being freshman, as shown by the inspire award (voted for by other teams for a team that is most inspiring). Since this was my first year in robotics, I still had things to learn.</p>

			<h2>In The Zone (2017-2018)</h2>

			<h3>The In The Zone Game</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game was to get the most cones stacked in your alliances zones. Cones had to be stacked on mobile goals or stationary goals to be scored. Mobile goals could only be moved by robots of their alliance's color, and bonus points were given for the tallest stacks in the five point, ten point, and twenty point zones. Since there was no fence dividing the field like Starstruck, it became popular for robots to simply drive forward across the field and hit an opposing robot during autonomous mode, the first fifteen seconds of a match were the robots operate independently on pre-programmed code. This was frustrating because teams could destroy a carefully planned autonomous with a few lazy lines of code. Fortunately in the next game, a rule was added to prevent this from happening.</p>

			<h3>Checkmate V2</h3>
			<p>For this game, Checkmate was a tall robot made up of a two section lift. The first section was a double bar lift, and the second was an arm with a small claw. This robot was very heavy and boxy, but this made it very steady, as it hardly ever had a problem with falling over. A small mobile goal lift was tucked in the back of the robot underneath the lift. This lift had to be slow and strong to carry and carefully place mobile goals with stacks of cones, so it had fifteen to one gearing. To prevent the mobile goal from being thrown out when the robot turned quickly, little angled nubs were on the very end of the mobile goal lift. These laid flat while the lift was down so a mobile goal could be picked up, but they turned upwards to hold the end of the goal inside of te lift. This mechanism could also be used to hook onto the underside of a mobile goal and pull it free from a pile of cones so it could be picked up in an area of the field with adequate space. A small but strong plunger/arm was used to slowly shove the mobile goal off of the robot. The claw was custom made from lexan, bent to fit the shape of a cone with the aid of a heat gun. </p>
			<p>This robot also used a variety of sensors. Limit switches were used to mark the top and bottom limits of the lift, which helped prevent the motors from burning out. These limit switches also reset the Integrated Motor Encoders inside the lift motors, because these had the annoying tendency to drift over time. An ultrasonic sonar sensor was used on the front of the robot to determine how far away cones and mobile goals were. A color sensor looked for yellow tape on the back fo the plunger to determine when to stop powering the motor, to help prevent the motor from burning out. An LCD screen was used right below the cortex to display various info for debugging. The competition judges were also a big fan of this. A sprocket gear on top of a potentiometer was used as a dial to easily select and change the robots autonomous. This allowed our team to easily adjust to our allied robot's autonomous. </p>
			
			<h3>Going To Worlds</h3>
			<p>5106C first qualified for the World Championships in 2018. It was the biggest and longest competition my team had ever been to, nevertheless competed in. On our first trip, we won the Think Award, which was an award for excellent autonomous programming. This was because our robot stacked cones automatically because it was too hard to move the first and second sections of the lift quickly and accurately in unison. Instead, the robot kept track of the current cone count and moved the lift sections in by pre-programmed amounts for the given cone number.</p>

			<p>5106C qualified and competed at the World Championships again in 2019. That year, 5106C ranked 6th in the qualifiers. Because of this, we were picked by 8223B to compete in the elimination rounds.</p>
