			<h2>Pathfinding</h2>
			<p>For the Mount Washington Valley Science Fair, my friend and I decided to create a robot that could find its way through a maze. This robot would have a start point and an end point. To make it easier, this robot would know what the maze looked like beforehand. </p>
			<h4>A* Algorithm</h4>
			<p>After some research, we decided thge robot should use an <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> to find its way through the maze. This would allow the robot to find the shortest and therefore most efficient path through the maze. An <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> measures three things while calculating the shortest path: the <mark>H cost</mark>, the <mark>F cost</mark>, and the <mark>G cost</mark>. These three costs are calculated for each tile that is visited. The <mark>G cost</mark> is the number of tiles it took to get to the given tile. The <mark>H cost</mark> is the estimated number of tiles it will take to get to the end. The <mark>F cost</mark> is the sum of the <mark>G cost</mark> and the <mark>H cost</mark>. The shortest path to the end would be the path along the lowest <mark>F costs</mark>.</p>
