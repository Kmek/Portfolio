			<h2>Pathfinding</h2>
			<p>For the Mount Washington Valley Science Fair, my friend and I decided to create a robot that could find its way through a maze. This robot would have a start point and an end point. To make it easier, this robot would know what the maze looked like beforehand. </p>
			<h4>A* Algorithm</h4>
			<p>After some research, we decided thge robot should use an <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> to find its way through the maze. This would allow the robot to find the shortest and therefore most efficient path through the maze. An <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> measures three things while calculating the shortest path: the <mark>H cost</mark>, the <mark>F cost</mark>, and the <mark>G cost</mark>. These three costs are calculated for each tile that is visited. The <mark>G cost</mark> is the number of tiles it took to get to the given tile. The <mark>H cost</mark> is the estimated number of tiles it will take to get to the end. The <mark>F cost</mark> is the sum of the <mark>G cost</mark> and the <mark>H cost</mark>. The shortest path to the end would be the path along the lowest <mark>F costs</mark>.</p>

			<p>The <mark>JavaScript</mark> Pathfinding Sim showed what the robot saw of the maze. The robot did not check random tiles, it checked tiles in the order that the <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> determined. The sim is slowed down, so it can show the progress of the robot. In the sim, white tiles are "open" unchecked tiles, so the robot can move on these. Black tiles are "closed", so they represent obstacles, walls, or any area the robot cannot enter. Orange tiles have been "checked", so each tile's <mark>H cost</mark>, <mark>F cost</mark>, and <mark>G cost</mark> has been calculated. These are also added to a list so they can be visited later. Blue tiles have been "visited", so the robot has added those tiles to a path, based off of the previous tile. Green tiles are the "shortest" path, so the robot has found the end on this path of tiles first, so it is the shortest and most efficient path to the end.</p> CONTINUE HERE

			<h3>The Robot</h3>
			<p>For a physical robot, my friend and I decided to use a V4 VEX Competition Robot. This robot had two motors with Integrated Motor Encoders (IMEs) to measure its position. Because we used a V4 Robot, the <mark>A* Algorithm</mark> had to be rewritten in <mark>C</mark>. Because I wrote the <mark>JavaScript</mark> program, my friend wrote the <mark>C</mark> program.</p>

			<p>To mimic the grid shown in the <mark>JavaScript</mark> program, we used a ten foot square of plywood. For the lines, black electrical tape was used to make a six by six grid of tiles for the robot.</p> CONTINUE HERE

			<p>The robot was about eight inches wide, just enough to carry its cortex, battery, and motors. Because the robot was so small, it was very lightweight. This caused some driving issues, as the robot would always drift to the left. </p> CONTINUE HERE
