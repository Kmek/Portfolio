Title: Pathfinding Science Fair

# Pathfinding Robot From Science Fair

For the MWV 2019 Science Fair, my friend Chani Mores and I created a small VEX robot that could find its way through a maze. 

To do this, we used an `A * Algorithm`. 
This type of algorithm measures the distance travelled and the distance to the goal, finding the shortest path to a goal.
