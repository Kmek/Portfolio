# CS50 Courses

## Computer Science 50 - AP

During my Sophomore year at Kennett High School, I took `CS50 AP`. 
Although I passed the AP exam, the course itself was not completely AP yet, which is why I took the course again my Senior year.
`CS50` was my first official Computer Science course, so it's where I got to learn the basics. 

`CS50 AP` started in `C`, which at one point was my favorite programming language (trust me, I've moved on).
This course has a collection of small problems to be solved, all of which could be checked, using `Check50`, before being submitted, using `Submit50`.
Through `CS50 AP`, I learned about variables, loops, and functions. 

---C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

* List of practice prblems
